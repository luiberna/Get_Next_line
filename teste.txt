Dwell on the beauty of life. 
Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them. 
Think constantly on the changes of the elements into each other, for such thoughts wash away the dust of earthly life.

Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.
-Marcus Aurelius
